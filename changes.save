class 'user' 
 - for looking up individual users, etc. not much in it

class 'users'
 - handles login/logout, registration

model 'sessions_model' and library 'my_session'
 - takes over from standard CI session class
 - keep track of inactivity, etc
 - refresh session info in the database. no need to store IP or useragent, so we use our own class.
 - upon login, need to createSession(userhash), then simply including library will maintain the data
 - login when already logged in, will check for inactivity. 
 -                 $this->my_session->checkAuth('login'); or 'vendor' or 'admin' to restrict page access
 - trying not to use username in the database or session, no need to have it. 

class 'curren	cies'
 - started putting the symbol onto the products pages

library 'my_captcha'
 - our own captcha class, uses the built in one for the image.
 - tracks users with a unique captcha key held in a session, rather than an IP address.
 
library layout
 - include this library when the data['title'] data['page'] variables are set
 - just call library, constructor does everything with data array, remaining info goes to the view.
 - this function is the only function to call this->load->view()
 - 'do not repeat yourself'
 - looks up session info for appropriate header (buyer/seller/admin/not logged in)

class 'pages'
 - sorted out 404's
